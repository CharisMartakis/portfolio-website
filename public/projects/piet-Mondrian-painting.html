        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project is a creative representation of a Piet Mondrian painting using HTML and CSS. The design captures the essence of Mondrian's abstract art style, characterized by a grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and the use of bold, contrasting colors along with white and gray. The layout is achieved through CSS Grid, allowing for a clean and structured appearance that reflects Mondrian's artistic principles.</p>
        <p>The project demonstrates the use of modern web technologies to recreate a piece of art, showcasing skills in HTML5 and CSS3. It emphasizes responsive design, ensuring that the artwork maintains its integrity across various screen sizes and devices.</p>
        <p>This project is part of my portfolio, highlighting my ability to blend creativity with technical skills in web development.</p>

        <h2>Project Process</h2>
        <p>To create this Mondrian-inspired project, I began by planning the overall approach and determining how best to translate the painting into HTML and CSS. I overlaid a grid on the real painting image, allowing me to divide it into as many rows and columns as needed for a detailed and accurate result. With this grid as a guide, I carefully mapped out each colored block and implemented them one by one using CSS Grid, ensuring that the proportions and placements closely matched the original artwork. </p>
        <p>Throughout the process, I focused on making the webpage responsive, using CSS Flexbox to display the real painting and my grid recreation side by side on larger screens, while stacking them vertically on smaller devices.</p>
        <p>This step-by-step method allowed me to blend creative problem-solving with technical skills, resulting in a faithful and adaptable digital representation of Mondrian’s style. </p>
